<p><b><i><font size="+2">Introduction</font></i></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">During this
semester, you will become very familiar with ordinary differential equations,
as the use of Newton's second law to analyze problems almost always produces
second time derivatives of position vectors.&nbsp; We spend a great deal
of time studying simple problems in depth mostly because of their transparency
- we can readily see and understand how a simple system evolves in time.&nbsp;
By the same token, it is important to realize that very few differential
equations that come from "real world" problems can be solved explicitly,
and often it is necessary to resort to numerical integration for their
solutions.&nbsp; Euler's method is the most basic integration technique
that we use in this class, and as is often the case in numerical methods,
the jump from this simple method to more complex methods is one of technical
sophistication, not conception.</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tutorial is intended for those
with minimal background in spreadsheet use, so if you have experience you
may want to skim the spreadsheet intro parts and pay attention to the later
detailed parts.&nbsp; Also, when you are done with this tutorial, please
<a href="mailto:mds217@psu.edu">email</a> the authors with your response
(see the very bottom of this page).</font>

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">Theory</font></i></b>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the equation of motion
for a single degree of freedom system can be written as the scalar equation:</font>
</p><center><b><font size="+2">a = f(v, x, t)</font></b></center>
<font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where a is the acceleration, v is the
velocity, x is the position and t is time.&nbsp; A well defined ODE also
has a set of boundary conditions given, so that the equation may be solved
for a unique solution.&nbsp; The boundary conditions take the form of an
initial position, and/or initial velocity value.&nbsp; Euler's method is
an iterative procedure (ie:&nbsp; it takes the initial values of position
and time, and the equation, and somehow comes up with a new set of values).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the real value of an integral of a function can be measured by the
area under the curve of that function, we can say that:</font>
<center><b><font size="+2">v(t+<font face="Symbol">D</font>t) = v(t)+area
under the a v/s. t curve from t to <font face="Symbol">D</font>t</font></b></center>

<center><b><font size="+2">x(t+<font face="Symbol">D</font>t) = x(t)+area
under the v v/s. t curve from t to <font face="Symbol">D</font>t</font></b></center>
<font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was presented in class and in the text,
(pps. 57-65) Euler's method makes the crude approximation that the area
under the curve between a known value of a function and the next value
in time can be approximated by a rectangle (See Fig 1).&nbsp; Of course,
since we know the leftmost side of the rectangle to be the initial value
of the function, the rectangle under the <b>a</b> v/s. <b>t</b> curve has
dimensions of <b>a(t)</b> and <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t</b>.&nbsp;
Likewise for the <b>v(t)</b> v/s. <b>t</b> rectangle.</font>
<center><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/graph1.gif" nosave="" border="5" height="293" width="423" align="ABSCENTER"></center>

<center><b><font size="+2">Fig 1</font></b></center>


<p><font size="+1"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>So then, if we want to iterate
one step forward in time, given the values of v(t1) and x(t1), we would
simply substitute in the area of the rectangle for the real integral and
get:</font>
</p><center><b><font size="+2">v(t2)=v(t1)+a(t1)*(t2-t1)</font></b></center>

<center><b><font size="+2">x(t2)=x(t1)+v(t1)*(t2-t1)</font></b></center>
<b><font size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b><font size="+1">Of course,
this is really a shabby kind of approximation, as can be seen from the
large triangle that we miss in the picture - but it has the one redeeming
quality that as <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t </b>goes to zero, the
error incurred by using the rectangle approximation also goes to zero.&nbsp;
So then, all we have to do is make <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t </b>small
enough and wait long enough for our computer to chug through all the calculations,
and we will get a reasonable approximation to the real solution.&nbsp;
Click <a href="https://sites.esm.psu.edu/courses/emch12/IntDyn/course-docs/Euler-tutorial/convergence.html">here</a> for a simple picture of this
convergence.&nbsp; Of course, as you may have suspected by now, there are
a few really pathological functions that people have concocted just for
the sole purpose of testing when numerical integration fails, but we don't
have to worry about those in this class.&nbsp; So, on we go . . .</font>

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">Application</font></i></b>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of the <a href="http://www.esm.psu.edu/courses/emch12/intdyn/activities/intro/gravity/default.html">first
activity</a> assignment involves solving, by Euler's method, the simple
pendulum equation derived in class:</font>
</p><center><b><font size="+2"><font face="Symbol">q</font>'' + (g/L)<font face="Symbol">q
</font>= 0</font></b></center>
<font size="+1">(where the double prime denotes a double time derivative).&nbsp;
Since this assignment must be completed using a spreadsheet program (preferable
Microsoft Excel), the approach here will be to step by step go through
the process of creating a spreadsheet, entering the data, and finally,
interpreting the output.</font>

<p><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/blu_bar.gif" nosave="" height="11" width="968">

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">The Excel Spreadsheet - Integrating the Equation</font></i></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">Spreadsheets are fairly simple to use
if you keep in mind that there are three main types of data structures
that can be entered into any one cell.&nbsp; If you always remember to
check what type of structure each cell contains, you will minimize your
chances of frustration.&nbsp; The first type of data is <b>text</b> - ie:&nbsp;
you type in a column heading that reminds you what is going to go in that
column, or you put your name in a cell at the top of the page, etc.&nbsp;
This type of data is very simple, because once it is entered, you probably
won't be messing around with it again.&nbsp; The hardest part about entering
text is selecting what size font you want.&nbsp; The second type of data
is <b>numeric</b> data.&nbsp; Numeric data is also easy to enter, you just
type it right into the box on the page.&nbsp; An example of numeric data
would be a constant that you need later (like g, the acceleration due to
gravity), or it might be some other parameters which are given and are
specific to your problem.&nbsp; In any case, numeric data can only be changed
when you erase what is in the cell, and type a new value.&nbsp; The final
type of data structure is a <b>formula</b>.&nbsp; A formula is more complicated
than the other two data structures, because it works in the background
and produces numeric or text data which actually shows up in the cell.&nbsp;
Formulas must be entered in a special way, so that the spreadsheet recognizes
them.&nbsp; A formula might tell the computer to add the numeric data of
the two cells above it and show the result in the appropriate cell.&nbsp;
So, just looking at what is in a cell is not good enough to define the
data type, because it is necessary to know whether the stuff in the cell
is being produced by a formula or whether is there because you typed it
there.</font>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">A quick note about formulas:&nbsp;
the key concept about a spreadsheet that is important to keep in mind is
the fact that you can copy formulas and paste them in other places, and
they index themselves!&nbsp; Say that you have two columns of data that
you need to add up separately.&nbsp; You would do this by making a formula
in the cell right below the first column that told the spreadsheet to add
up all the numbers in that column.&nbsp; Then, what would you do about
adding up the numbers in the second column?&nbsp; You could type in the
formula again, but there is an easier way - just copy the formula from
the first column and then paste in the cell below the second column.&nbsp;
What happens?&nbsp; The spreadsheet "knows" that you want to add up the
second row and not the first, so it changes the index for you.&nbsp; This
is the whole idea behind spreadsheets - paste functions across and down
and the indexing will take care of itself.&nbsp; Of course, sometimes you
may not want the index to change, like when you are referencing a constant
- we'll cover that shortly.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so now that we have outlined what
we want to accomplish with Euler's method, and how we are going to accomplish
it via the spreadsheet, let's go through the steps:&nbsp; First, let's
enter some text into the spreadsheet, to define the columns of information
that we are going to tabulate.&nbsp; Fig 2 shows how to do this.&nbsp;
Simply click your cursor over the cell you like, and you will see it become
highlighted with a outlined box.&nbsp; Then, just type in at the keyboard
what you want to appear in the cell.&nbsp; Also notice that what you type
will appear in the cell which lies above the top row of sheet but below
the toolbar.&nbsp; We'll come back to this special cell later.&nbsp; In
this example, I have typed in the word "Time" to denote the column which
will become the data of the cumulative time traversed by the differential
equation.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/pict1.jpg" nosave="" border="5" height="239" width="639" align="ABSCENTER">
<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 2 - entering text</font></b>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other text that we need can also be
entered, as shown in Fig 3.&nbsp; I have made a separate column for the
four different categories of data that we will need for each iteration:&nbsp;
the current time (<b>t</b>), the current position (<b><font face="Symbol">q</font></b>),
the current velocity (<b><font face="Symbol">q</font>'</b>), and the current
acceleration (<b><font face="Symbol">q</font>''</b>).&nbsp; In addition,
I have created a special section for the constants of the problem, namely,
the time step (<b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t</b>) which we will be using,
and the quantity <b>g/L</b> which we will need shortly.</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/pict2.jpg" nosave="" border="5" height="239" width="639" align="ABSCENTER">
<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 3 - more text</font></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">Next, we proceed to enter the known
initial conditions for time t=0.&nbsp; Since we want to model the swinging
pendulum experiment that we did in Kunkle Lounge, we put the initial position
to some value (this really is up to you to decide what to put here, but
for this example you might want to work along with me and use the same
numbers I do.&nbsp; You can always change them later - after all, they
are just numeric data!)&nbsp; I choose the initial position as 0.5, the
initial velocity as 0, the time step as 0.1, and g/L as 1.&nbsp; Putting
in everything we know, we get the following picture (Fig 4).&nbsp; <b>Notice
that text data is justified to the left of the cell, and numeric data to
the right of the cell.&nbsp; </b>This is just a convention that helps to
distinguish between the two.</font>

</p><p><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/pict3.jpg" nosave="" border="5" height="240" width="639" align="ABSCENTER">
<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 4 - numeric data</font></b>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, now comes the hard part:&nbsp;
formulas.&nbsp; Since we have exhausted all the known data of our problem,
we now have to use other facets of our problem to fill in the blanks.&nbsp;
What about the acceleration at t=0?&nbsp; Is there an equation that we
have for that?&nbsp; Check back above in case you forgot.</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that we can relate the acceleration
and position of the pendulum at any instant in time through the governing
equation, we now need to let the spreadsheet know about this equation.&nbsp;
First, place your cursor over the cell for the acceleration at t=0 and
click.&nbsp; See figure 5:</font>

</p><p><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/pict4.jpg" nosave="" border="5" height="241" width="639" align="ABSCENTER">
<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 5 - the beginning of a function</font></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">Next, in order to denote that we are
entering an equation, type an equals sign (=) into the special cell that
lies above the top row and under the toolbar.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; you can
also just click on the equals sign that is right there).&nbsp; Now, type
in the equation - since we know that the acceleration is given by -(g/L)*<b><font face="Symbol">q</font>
</b>we tell the spreadsheet to multiply the value found in the G4 cell
by the value found in the B4 cell.&nbsp; In addition to this, we need to
make sure the spreadsheet understands that the quantity (g/L) will <b>always
</b>be found in the G4 cell, so we denote this type of absolute reference
by preceding each character by a "string" marker ($).&nbsp; Now, if we
paste the function somewhere else, the reference to cell G5 won't change
to G6, etc. but will always be the same.&nbsp; But, since the value of
theta found in cell B4 is only good for the first time step, we don't want
that reference to stay constant, so we don't include the $ markers for
it.&nbsp; The final equation will look like Fig 6.&nbsp; Hit the return
key to enter it in.</font>

<font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have entered this function,
and it is working in the background, it produces a number.&nbsp; Check
to see that this number is ok, it should appear as in Fig 7.&nbsp; If you
ever forget whether -0.5 is numeric data or data produced by a function,
just click on the cell and the function will appear in the special cell
again.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, now we have filled in completely
the t=0 line, so it's time to move on, literally.&nbsp; We first need to
define the next time interval.&nbsp; Do this by entering a formula for
the time t=1.&nbsp; Add the value of <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t </b>to
the value of t in the cell directly above it.&nbsp; <b>Don't just type</b>
in the number .001, but instead reference the cell where <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t
</b>is located, that way if you want to change <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t
</b>later on all you'll have to do is change one cell and all the rest
will automatically update themselves.&nbsp; Don't forget to make it an
absolute reference!&nbsp; When you are done, your equation should look
like:&nbsp; =A4+$F$5&nbsp; The value of .001 should appear in the cell
as expected.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, finally, we get to put old Euler
to work:&nbsp; If you don't remember how to get the next value of the position
in time, refresh your memory by looking back above.&nbsp; The equation
you enter into the B5 cell should look like:&nbsp; =B4+C4*(A5-A4)&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Next, using the same approximation, move on to the B6 cell and
enter the correct equation for the value of the velocity.&nbsp; The answer
it produces when you hit the enter key should be -.05&nbsp; Now for the
last cell in the time step t=1.&nbsp; Since we have already typed in the
formula which relates the acceleration to the position of the pendulum
at any instant, all that we need do is copy the equation from the t=0 cell
to the t=1 cell.&nbsp; Do this by first highlighting the D4 cell and the
D5 cell simultaneously (ie:&nbsp; hold down the button while moving the
mouse over both of them)&nbsp; Then either click on the Edit-&gt;Paste Down
menu or just type in Control-D and the formula will automatically copy
itself into the D5 cell.&nbsp; Compare the two equations in the D4 and
D5 cell.&nbsp; Why did some of the numbers change, and some did not?</font>

<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 8 - copying an equation</font></b>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whew! we have finally typed in all
the equations we need.&nbsp; Now it's time to iterate!&nbsp; But before
you do that, it is probably a good idea to save your work.&nbsp; Next,
highlight all four cells<b> in the t=1 row only</b>.&nbsp; Then, like before,
drag down to paste the formulas down.&nbsp; Note that if you click and
drag the lower right corner of the cell (where the little fancy square
is) the spreadsheet will automatically copy everything for you.&nbsp; You
are integrating forward in time!&nbsp; For a start, I copied down to the
210th cell.</font>

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">The Excel Spreadsheet - Plotting the Results</font></i></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">Ok, now that we have solved the equation
numerically, how do we visualize the results?&nbsp; Obviously we need to
make some sort of plot.&nbsp; Do this easily by clicking on the "B" button,
which highlights the whole B column (See Fig 9).</font>

a line chart).&nbsp; You can click on the sample button to get an idea
of what the chart will look like.&nbsp; When you are satisfied, click on
the "finish" button, and there you go.&nbsp; You can drag the chart wherever
you want to put it.&nbsp; Hopefully you got something like Fig 10.&nbsp;
Notice that the horizontal axis is the row number of the cell that each
data point comes from.&nbsp; You can have fun and double click all over
the chart to bring up menus that allow you to change the color, labels,
x-axis data, etc - but I just left it plain Jane.</font>

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">Interpreting the Results</font></i></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">Ok, now for the fun part - where you
can ask yourself the question, "What does it all mean?"&nbsp; The first
thing that you should notice (knowing from class that the correct solution
to the DE is a cosine function of constant amplitude)&nbsp; is that the
amplitude seems to be getting very large, very fast.&nbsp; In fact, we
started out with an amplitude of 0.5 and after 20s we have an amplitude
of over twice as large!&nbsp; Of course one interpretation of this phenomena
is that we discovered a perpetual motion machine (or perhaps people walking
on the overhead bridges in Kunkle were adding energy to our system).&nbsp;
On the more cautious side, the other possibility is that our solution is
not very accurate.&nbsp; After all, 0.1s is kind of a big value for <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t</b>.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve the accuracy of the solution,
we need to make <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>t </b>smaller.&nbsp; Since
we were foresighted enough to make an absolute reference to the one cell
containing the time step information, all we need to is change the value
in the F5 cell to something smaller, and the rest will take care of itself.&nbsp;
I chose to change the time step to 0.01.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that the chart also changed,
but this time we don't get to see much happening, because now we are only
seeing about 2s worth of oscillation.&nbsp; The solution to this?&nbsp;
Just go down to the bottom row of your cells, and integrate forward some
more in time.&nbsp; I went a bit further this time and dragged the corner
down to the 3000th cell.&nbsp; Also, you will need to change the range
on your graph so that it reads all the way down there.&nbsp; Do this by
clicking on the chart (so that it is outlined in little black boxes) and
then click on the chart-&gt;source data menu.&nbsp; Change the line that says:&nbsp;
Sheet1!$B$2:$B$210&nbsp; to:&nbsp; Sheet1!$B$2:$B$<b>3000&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;
This will instruct the chart to read all the data.&nbsp; How does the amplitude
change with time now?&nbsp; You may want to save your graphs using different
time steps, for later comparison.</font>

</p><p><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/blu_bar.gif" nosave="" height="11" width="968">

</p><p><b><i><font size="+2">Measuring the Period of Oscillation</font></i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to complete the assignment, we
need to measure the period of the oscillation.&nbsp; There are a few ways
that you could do this, so if you have an idea - then try it out!&nbsp;
The way I'm going to present is only one way out of many.&nbsp; You can
check your final answer with mine though if you like.</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I created four more text cells
in a row, with their corresponding data cells right below them.&nbsp; (see
Fig 11)&nbsp; To measure the period we need to know the number of time
steps traversed between two points on the graph of the same phase.&nbsp;
Since our oscillation started out at max amplitude, I first called a function
that finds the maximum value in the B column.&nbsp; Since the amplitude
is still increasing a little each time, the =MAX(B4:B2760) function will
pick out the value of the last amplitude peak on the graph.&nbsp; I put
this function in the F23 cell.&nbsp; Then I employed a function in the
G23 cell which was:&nbsp; =MATCH(F23,B4:B2760,0).&nbsp; The match function
returns the row number of the cell which has the value found in F23, namely
the max value!&nbsp; That way, I then know the time interval during which
the last peak in amplitude occurs.&nbsp; <b>You can look up help on these
functions and more through the online help</b>.&nbsp; In the third cell,
I put a space for how many peaks occurred in the graph.&nbsp; I just had
to enter this number visually each time the graph changed.&nbsp; Finally,
in the fourth cell, I entered the equation:&nbsp; =(G23-4)*F5/H23&nbsp;
so that I would get the period - total time traversed divided by the number
of wavelengths traversed.&nbsp; I had four peaks, and so my measured period
turned out to be 6.2775.</font>

</p><p><img src="./Euler&#39;s Method Tutorial_files/pict11a.jpg" nosave="" border="5" height="461" width="639" align="ABSCENTER">
<br><b><font size="+1">Fig 11 - the completed worksheet</font></b>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we solved this DE <i>exactly</i>
in class, we know what the actual period <i>should</i> be:&nbsp; the formula
for the period is:&nbsp; P=2<b><font face="Symbol">p</font>/<font face="Symbol">w</font></b></font>&nbsp;
<font size="+1">And the formula for the angular frequency is root(g/L).&nbsp;
Therefore, for my value of g/L of 1.0, the period should be around 6.2832.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few notes on this method.&nbsp; If
your initial value for the velocity is anything but zero, you will have
to put in another function that finds the first maximum value on the graph
since t=0 won't be at the maximum aplitude anymore.&nbsp; Just remember
that you need to get two points of exactly the same phase.&nbsp; If you
want to change the time step and number of cells integrated you must change
the following:&nbsp; index of chart data, index of max value function,
index of match function, #of peaks observed cell.&nbsp; Of course, your
error of the period you get will depend strongly on how large your time
step is, and how far you integrated in time.&nbsp; You will also will want
to measure the period for different amplitudes, which is now easy to do
- just change the initial conditions.&nbsp; Have fun!</font>
